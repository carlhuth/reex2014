a Rule Engine EXercise for 2014

My name is Matteo, I'm a [Computer Science Engineer](http://www.linkedin.com/in/matteomortari) and I do believe there is a whole new range of unexplored applications for Expert Systems (AI) in Big Data scenarios, also within the Corporate business. You can read more about me on [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/matteomortari).

I've found interest in Rule Engine applications while studying at University, and since, this has grown as a kind of NERD interest also on a personal perspective.

This is the reason every year I attempt an hobby-project where I can find an interesting application.

The theme I've chosen for this year 2014, is to solve a very practical problem: monitor data sources and social media for potential public transport issues, which I use for commuting. From a technological perspective, I've also wanted to seize a chance to experiment integrating several technologies.

In summary

GOALs
* Monitor data sources and social media for potential public transport issues
* Use Expert Systems (AI) - Rule Engine [drools.org](http://drools.org)
* Experiment for integration of other technologies like PaaS, Java EE, Camel, Android

NON-GOALs
* This is not an exercise of Sentiment analysis nor of Natural language processing
* This is not an exercise to imitate other more complex systems for public transport information communications
